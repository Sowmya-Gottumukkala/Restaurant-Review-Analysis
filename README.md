# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis with NLP and Naive Bayes Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to provide sentiment analysis for restaurant reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with a Naive Bayes classifier. The goal is to categorize reviews as either positive or negative, thereby aiding restaurant owners and managers in understanding customer sentiment and making informed decisions. 

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data: Cleaning and preparing the raw text data for analysis.
- Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the preprocessed text data.
- Naive Bayes classifier: Training a Naive Bayes classifier model to classify reviews.
- Performance evaluation: Assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the classifier in categorizing reviews.
- Insightful analysis: Providing insights into customer sentiments based on the classified reviews.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the raw text data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data.
3. **Classifier Training**: Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the extracted features.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use the trained classifier to categorize restaurant reviews as positive or negative.
6. **Decision Making**: Utilize the insights gained from the sentiment analysis to make informed decisions regarding restaurant management and customer satisfaction.
